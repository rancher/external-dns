external-dns
==========
Service updating external DNS with records generated by Rancher. Initial version comes with Route53 support; pluggable provider model makes it easy to implement other providers later.

Design
==========
* external-dns gets deployed as a Rancher service containerized app. It enables all other services belonging to the same environment, to be registered to external DNS.

* external-dns service would be periodically fetching info from rancher-metadata server, compare it with the data returned by DNS provider, and propagate the changes to DNS provider.

* Every service will get a domain name in a following format:

```
<service_name>.<stack_name>.<environment_name>.<root_domain> {record set}
```
"root_domain" is a user set env var on external-dns service; record set - host ip addresses where service is deployed.

Example: service "foo" in stack "bar" belongs to environment "baz" has containers deployed on host1 and host2. Root_domain is set to "qux.com":

```
foo.bar.baz.qux.com [host1.ip, host2.ip]
```
